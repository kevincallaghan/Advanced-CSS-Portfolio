## Credits

For the text-overlay on the Project Images, I used CSS from w3schools.com.  The CSS was found on the "How To - Text Blocks Over Image" page: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_text_blocks.asp 

I used a README template found on coding-boot-camp.github.io at: https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide 

I used css-tricks.com's article titled "A Complete Guide to Flexbox" by Chris Coyier to help with my flexbox CSS.  The article is found here: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/
