            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              In college I chose to persue a career in sales, leading me to graduate with a Bachelor's in Marketing and accepting a job as an Account Manager / Sales Representative.
              <br><br>
              After dipping my feet into the world of sales for a year, I was given an opportunity to shift into the web development industry to a position where I provided client services and technical support to high profile law enforcement and government agencies.  During my time in this position I gained nearly a decade of experience in training clients to use custom web applications and I served as the middle-man between clients and the programming team to customize and create applications that met the client needs.
              <br><br>
              In 2023 I made the decision to advance my career and fully dive into the web development industry and enrolled in the University of Texas Coding Bootcamp.
